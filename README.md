# tailwind-perspective

I was a little disappointed that tailwind didn't natively support 3d transforms, so I took it upon myself to extend that functionality with this plugin

## Installation

`pnpm i -D tailwind-perspective`
`yarn add -D tailwind-perspective`
`npm i -D tailwind-perspective`

## Usage

Coming at some point (busy with big projects)
